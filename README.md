# Midterm Project - Python Socket Programming & Port Scanner 

This repository contains two Python-based cybersecurity tools developed as part of a midterm assignment:  
1. A basic **client-server socket communication system**
2. A **network port scanner**

The project demonstrates a practical understanding of network programming using sockets, error handling, ethical scanning, and Python best practices.

## Midterm Project Breakdown

### Part 1: Socket Connection Implementation

A basic client-server system using Pythonâ€™s `socket` module. Two scripts were created:

- `server.py`: Listens for incoming connections
- `client.py`: Connects to the server and sends messages
- 
---

### Part 2: Port Scanner Implementation 

A Python port scanner to identify open ports on a given target using socket connections.

- Script: `port_scanner.py`

#### WWhat it does:
- User inputs: host, start port, end port
- Identifies open ports
- Validates input and handles errors
- Tracks scan duration
